# hulktastic

JDK 1.8,
Eclipse IDE

Description
===========

If you need to generate a bunch of images to train a Neural Net and don't want to spend thousands of hours, hulktastic can generate them for you. Create a foreground image with alpha channels (ie transparency) and a collection of background photos. The utilty will randomly place the foreground on the background and crop it to the desired size.
